# Global Code Queens Open Source Project

This is an open source project developed as part of the [Open Source Project](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/frontendqueens_opensource-collaboration-community-activity-7201980886232317952-VBld?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) initiative by the [FrontEnd Queens](https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontendqueens/)

## The Challenge
The challenge is to build out a multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Design
The challenge is part of [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) premium version, hence we are not adding a link of the Design file here.

## More details will be added in due course of time
